## Deployment and Testing on Local Server

To deploy and test the project on a local server, follow these steps:

1. Install Python: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download and install the latest version of Python from the official Python website [python.org](https://www.python.org)..

2. Set Up a Virtual Environment: Create a virtual environment for your project to isolate its dependencies. Open your command-line interface, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   
3. Activate the Virtual Environment: Activate the virtual environment by running the appropriate command for your operating system:
   - Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install Dependencies: Install the required Python packages by executing the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Set Up the Database: Set up a MySQL database using phpMyAdmin or any other MySQL administration tool. Create a new database for the project and import the provided SQL file to initialize the tables and sample data.

6. Configure the Database Connection: In the project's configuration file (`config.py` or similar), modify the database connection settings to match your local MySQL configuration. Update the database host, username, password, and database name accordingly.

7. Run the Application: Start the Flask development server by running the following command in the project directory:
   ```
   flask run
   ```

8. Access the Application: Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or the URL provided by the Flask server). The application should now be running locally.

9. Test the Application: Use the web interface to interact with the database and test the CRUD functionalities. Create, read, update, and delete records to ensure that the application behaves as expected. Verify that the data is correctly stored and retrieved from the database.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully deploy and test the project on your local server.
