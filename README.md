## Our Vision for Fun and Functionality

Welcome to "Board Game Rentals," where the love for board games meets the finesse of technology! This document isn't just a manual; it's a glimpse into our passion for creating a space where board game cafes and their patrons can connect effortlessly.

## Goals: The Heart of Our Game

Our mission? To build a web interface that's not just functional but also a joy to use. Think of it as the perfect blend of tech and fun, offering Create-Read-Update-Delete (CRUD) capabilities with a twist of user-friendly design.

## Building Blocks: Our Game Plan

Here's what makes our project tick:

1. **Data Playground**: Our database is a treasure trove, pre-loaded with games to showcase every feature in full color.
2. **Relational Dynamics**: We've crafted a web of entities and relationships, including a many-to-many relationship that's as intriguing as a game strategy.
3. **Admin's Arena**: Designed for those behind the scenes (the cafÃ© wizards), our interface focuses on managing the magic, not the mundane.
4. **One Page, One Story**: Each database entity gets its own spotlight in our UI, making navigation a part of the adventure.
5. **Optional Home Base**: A welcoming home page to kick things off? Your call!

## Executive Summary: Leveling Up

### Refining the Game Board

- Ditched the redundant table to streamline our data flow.
- Upgraded key tables for better performance and clarity.

### Master Moves Implemented

- Added nuances with nullable relationships.
- Integrated cascade delete for a flawless game experience.
- Leveraged join queries for smarter, faster data retrieval.

### Evolution Through Feedback

We shifted gears from Node.js to Flask, a move inspired by hands-on experience and valuable feedback. The result? A smoother, more efficient pathway to delivering an exceptional board game rental experience.

## The Challenge and Our Solution

**The Quest**: In a world where board games became the heroes of home entertainment, board game cafes sprouted up needing a digital ally.

**Our Magic Potion**: A web-based beacon that guides cafÃ© owners through the maze of game rentals and inventory management.

## Toolkit of Choice

- **Flask**: Our wizard's wand for web development.
- **MySQL**: The backbone of our data kingdom.
- **phpMyAdmin & SQL Workbench**: Our crystal balls for database interactions.
- **Jinja2 & Bootstrap**: The artists painting our UI with strokes of functionality and style.

## Deployment and Testing on Local Server

To deploy and test the project on a local server, follow these steps:

1. Install Python: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download and install the latest version of Python from the official Python website [python.org](https://www.python.org)..

2. Set Up a Virtual Environment: Create a virtual environment for your project to isolate its dependencies. Open your command-line interface, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   
3. Activate the Virtual Environment: Activate the virtual environment by running the appropriate command for your operating system:
   - Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install Dependencies: Install the required Python packages by executing the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Set Up the Database: Set up a MySQL database using phpMyAdmin or any other MySQL administration tool. Create a new database for the project and import the provided SQL file to initialize the tables and sample data.

6. Configure the Database Connection: In the project's configuration file (`config.py` or similar), modify the database connection settings to match your local MySQL configuration. Update the database host, username, password, and database name accordingly.

7. Run the Application: Start the Flask development server by running the following command in the project directory:
   ```
   flask run
   ```

8. Access the Application: Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or the URL provided by the Flask server). The application should now be running locally.

9. Test the Application: Use the web interface to interact with the database and test the CRUD functionalities. Create, read, update, and delete records to ensure that the application behaves as expected. Verify that the data is correctly stored and retrieved from the database.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully deploy and test the project on your local server.
